    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Leigh Lewis. I am a photographer currently based in Los Angeles, California. I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Loyola Marymount University. </p>
    <p>I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama, watching my mom shoot food photography for her personal blog, and I quickly became interested in photography. I took a few photography classes at my high school and was soon being featured on my mom's blog, Ingredientsinc.net.</p>
    <p>Besides photography, I have strong interests in videography and technology. I also love the outdoors and try my best to live a healthy lifestyle.</p>
